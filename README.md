Dissertation topic - Enhancing battery power and energy output while keeping its service life unaffected.
These are the codes created for the dissertation of MSc. Sustainable Automotive Electrification course of WMG,The University of Warwick.
PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling), which is open source battery modelling package, is used to create battery models.
To run these codes, first PyBaMM must be installed on the system. Link of installation instructions - "https://www.pybamm.org/getting-started#h.78ov3gnx2o82"
These codes are for 2 conditions: Constant Power and Constant Current output.
These codes will generate rate-capability data of the batery cell which can be used to understand impact of high power and current extraction from the battery cell on its energy and capacity respectively.
